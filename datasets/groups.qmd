## Data collection

All groups and the countries in which they predominently operate were identified in K. Cunningham's [*Inside the Politics of Self-Determination*](http://www.kathleengallaghercunningham.com/research.html).

A group's start date is set to the first identified as the highest of either:

1. The start date for any of its composite organizations; or, 
2. The first year in the dataset: 1960. 

A group's end date is set to the last identified year in which one of their composite organizations was identified as active.
