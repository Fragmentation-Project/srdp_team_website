## Overview

This dataset describes each self-determination group's specific SD-related demands made. It forms the backbone of the SRDP dataset: if an organization is not making SD demands, it is considered inactive. If an organization is inactive for three or more years, it exits the dataset. Because groups consist of organizations, a group's existence is also defined from these demands.
