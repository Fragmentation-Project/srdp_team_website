You need to find evidence that the organisation itself made a demand that falls into one of our broad categories. It is not sufficient for the news article to describe the organisation as separatist.\nOnce you identify a demand made by the SD organisation, head back to the data collection app.\nCheck whether the demand is already listed.\n\nIf yes:\n\nAnd the information is correct:\n\nUpdate the to do list to mark that organisation-year as done.\n\nAnd the information is incorrect:\n\nClick the green + button to add more information.\nAre you editing a previously coded demand?
