**Strategies of Resistance Data Project** (SRDP) is a global dataset on organizational behavior in self-determination disputes. It is actor-focused and spans periods of relative peace and violence in self-determination conflicts. By linking tactics to specific actors in broader campaigns for political change, we can better understand how these struggles unfold over time, and the conditions under which organizations use conventional politics, violent tactics, nonviolent tactics, or some combination of these.
